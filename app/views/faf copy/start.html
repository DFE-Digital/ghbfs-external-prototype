        <p>You can use frameworks without having to run a full buying process.</p>

        <p>Each framework agreement has:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>details of products, services and suppliers available</li>
          <li>an agreed pricing structure and terms and conditions</li>
          <li>guidance on how to buy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Buying from a framework can be quicker and easier than getting bids or quotes because the agreements:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>have already been through a full competitive tender process</li>
          <li>have been quality checked</li>
          <li>are checked to make sure they comply with the law</li>
          <li>may have draft specifications and help available</li>
        </ul>

          text: "Continue"
        }) }}
