        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Energy bill relief scheme</h2>
        <p><a href="energy-bill-relief-scheme">The Energy bill relief scheme (EBRS)</a> is a discount on the wholesale price of gas and electricity for non-domestic customers like schools. It will fix prices for 6 months from 1 October 2022 and will apply to contracts agreed on or after 1 April 2022. Other costs that are included in your bill, like administration fees or taxes, are not affected and will stay the same.</p>
        <p>You do not have to apply for the scheme, <strong>the discount will be automatically applied</strong> to your bills.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Don’t let your energy contract expire</h2>
        <p>It’s important that you do not let your energy contract expire. Out of contract costs can be significantly higher and have less favourable terms and conditions.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Renewing your contract</h2>
        <p>If your renewal is due in the next three months you could try getting a short-term contract for 3, 6 or 12 months. Shorter term contracts mean you have more flexibility to change your approach.</p>
